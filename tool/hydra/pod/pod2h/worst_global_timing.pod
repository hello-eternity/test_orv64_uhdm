=head1 NAME

worst_global_timing - report the worst global timing on an sta run

=head1 SYNOPSIS

hydra.pl worst_global_timing B<-rpt_dir> I<DIR>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script reads global timing across all sta scenarios and reports the worst scenarios for each category, which is each combination of mode, setup/hold delay, and worst/total negative flop-to-flop slack. A scenario will only be considered for setup if its rc corner ends in "_T", which signifies that it has particularly pessimistic setup timing. Accordingly, a scenario will only be considered for hold if its rc corner does not end in "_T".

The worst scenarios are reported in the output file "summary.rpt".

A second output file "all.rpt" lists the global timing summary for every scenario for a convenient reference.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-rpt_dir>

A directory containing sta timing reports. Reports should be grouped inside subdirectories for each scenario, with the following naming convention. If you use Hydra Setup for your sta run, this convention will be automatically used.
 <mode>.<process>.<temp>.<rc>

Inside the scenario subdirectory, there should be a global_timing.rpt that was generated by "report_global_timing". If a setup.global_timing.rpt or hold.global_timing.rpt, then the script will create them based on global_timing.rpt and place them in the corresponding directory.
