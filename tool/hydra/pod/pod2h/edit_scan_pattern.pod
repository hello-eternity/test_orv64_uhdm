=head1 NAME

edit_scan_pattern - list scan patterns by register value to aid in scan pattern editing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

hydra.pl edit_scan_pattern B<-chain_file> I<FILE> [B<-pattern_file> I<FILE>] [B<-register_file> I<FILE>] [B<-out_file> I<FILE>] [B<-create_random_pattern> I<on|off>] [B<-bit_blast> I<on|off>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script works in one of two modes: pattern-to-register mode and register-to-pattern mode. When B<-pattern_file> is defined, pattern-to-register mode is activated. When B<-regiser_file> is defined, register-to-pattern mode is activated.

In pattern-to-register mode, scan patterns are read from B<-pattern_file> and matched to the registers found in B<-chain_file>. The output file is "register.txt", which contains each register's value as defined by the scan pattern.

In register-to-pattern mode, register values are read from B<-register_file>. The scan pattern is then constructed using those values and the scan order found in B<-chain_file>, and is written to the output file "pattern.txt".

The intended workflow is:
 1. Generate a chain file from Tetramax.
 2. Generate/obtain an initial pattern file.
 3. Run pattern-to-register mode to generate register.txt.
 4. Edit register.txt.
 5. Run register-to-pattern mode to generate pattern.txt.

Some bits of a register may not be included in any scan pattern. The value for unused bits will be automatically set to "0".

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-chain_file>

The chain file is a report generated by Tetramax using the command "report_scan_cells". It defines register names and scan ordering. It is used for both pattern-to-register mode and register-to-pattern mode.

=item B<-pattern_file>

If this is defined, then pattern-to-register mode is activated. The format is:

 <chain_name> : <chain_pattern>

=item B<-register_file>

If this is defined, then register-to-pattern mode is activated. The format is:

 <register_name> = <hex_value>

=item B<-out_file>

Output file name. For pattern-to-register mode, this defaults to "./register.txt". For register-to-pattern mode, this defaults to "./pattern.txt". Optional.

=item B<-create_random_pattern>

If this is set to "on", then pattern-to-register mode is activated. Instead of providing a pattern file yourself, this option will enable generation of random scan patterns for testing. Optional. Default="off".

=item B<-bit_blast>

If this is set to "off", then all bit dimensions will be combined in the output register file for pattern-to-register mode. If this is set to "on", then only the first dimension will be combined. All dimensions after the first will be bit blasted, resulting in multiple value entries for a single multi-dimensional register. It is recommended to leave this to "on" to avoid large unwieldy values. Optional. Default="on".
