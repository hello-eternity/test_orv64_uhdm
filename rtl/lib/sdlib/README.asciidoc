The Srdy-Drdy library is an interface standard for connecting RTL blocks together
in an FPGA and ASIC with a unidirectional interface that provides bidirectional
flow control.  The library is also a set of components which are compliant to the
interface definition and provide a variety of functions from basic timing closure
to buffering and arbitration between blocks.
