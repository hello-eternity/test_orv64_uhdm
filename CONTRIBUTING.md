# Contributing
We highly appreciate community contributions. If you want to do contribution to the project, please:

* Create your own branch to commit your changes and then open a Pull Request.
* Split large contributions into smaller commits addressing individual changes or bug fixes. Only include one change in per commit.
* Write meaningful commit messages. For more information, please check out the [commit guide](#commit-guide).
* If asked to modify your changes, do fixup your commits and rebase your branch to maintain a clean history.
